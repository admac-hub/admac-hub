# 👋 Hey, I'm Admac

I'm a full-stack developer and systems engineer focused on building practical tools that **solve real problems** — and make life easier for other developers.

## 🧠 What I Build

### 🔐 MERN Role-Based Auth System
Production-ready authentication boilerplate using:
- ✅ Role-based access (User & Vendor)
- 🔐 JWT with HTTP-only cookies
- 🧾 Scalable backend with Express & Mongoose
- 🧩 Clean folder structure & vendor onboarding

> 👉 Fork it, plug it in, and get building faster.

---

### 🐍 Python Task Automation Scripts
I also create simple but powerful Python tools for automating daily dev and ops tasks:
- 🔄 File cleaners, PDF renamers, and report generators
- 🗃️ Cron-ready CLI utilities for organizing local or cloud data
- 💡 Great for sysadmins, solo devs, or students

---

### ⚡ Dev Kits Worth Forking
Some of my repos are made to be cloned, customized, and launched in real apps:
- 📦 Minimal React + Express starter projects
- 🔧 Frontend-ready auth APIs with validation + routing
- 🚀 Clean base apps for SaaS or admin dashboards
